# *Emowise: Personalized AI for Emotional WellBeing*

### About the Project
This project aims to improve classification tasks by using dimensionality reduction techniques to satellite photography data, specifically distinguishing between ship and no-ship images. The effectiveness of the chosen methods in capturing important data structures is assessed. These methods include principal component analysis (PCA) and manifold learning algorithms such as ISOMAP.
The approach places a strong emphasis on preparing, presenting, and classifying the data using Python-based machine learning frameworks and data analysis modules. Standardizing input features, applying dimensionality reduction strategies, and developing models to improve performance are all crucial tasks. 


## Datasets
The dataset are larger than 25MB and can't be uploaded here 
Hence make sure that you take the data from your side by downloading it from Canvas
## Code Implementation 

In order to understand the project, you are supposed to run training file that allows you to get pickle files to save and then go to testing sile to calculate the performance metrics of each pipeline and classifier that are coded in training file.


## Dependencies

In order to update anaconda,use the following command
```sh
  conda update --all
```

## Clone the repo
The repository should be cloned using hipergator only

```sh
